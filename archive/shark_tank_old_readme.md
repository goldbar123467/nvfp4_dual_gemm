# 🦈 GPU OPTIMIZATION SHARK TANK 🦈

## Season 1: The Quest for Speed-of-Light

**Current Performance:** ~373 µs (14th place)
**Target Performance:** ~30 µs (1st place)
**Gap to Close:** ~12x

---

## The Format

### Round Structure
1. **Pitch Phase** - 4 contestants present their optimization proposals
2. **Shark Vote** - AI sharks evaluate and vote on which to implement
3. **Implementation** - Winner gets implemented
4. **Benchmark** - Test the results
5. **Repeat** - Until we reach the top!

## The Contestants

### 🔵 Contestant #1: Pipeline Stages
> "More stages, more speed!"

### 🟢 Contestant #2: Tile Size Tuning
> "Size matters in the GPU world!"

### 🟡 Contestant #3: TMA Store Epilogue
> "The last mile is the fastest mile!"

### 🔴 Contestant #4: Warp Specialization
> "Divide and conquer at warp speed!"

## The Sharks

Three AI sharks will evaluate each pitch based on:
- **Expected Speedup** (40%)
- **Implementation Complexity** (25%)
- **Risk Level** (20%)
- **Pitch Quality** (15%)

## Scoreboard

| Round | Winner | Before | After | Improvement |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | TBD | 373 µs | ? | ? |
| 2 | TBD | ? | ? | ? |
| 3 | TBD | ? | ? | ? |

---

## Rules

1. Each optimization gets ONE chance to pitch
2. Sharks vote independently
3. Majority wins
4. If implementation fails, we rollback and try #2
5. Eliminated optimizations can return in later rounds with improvements
