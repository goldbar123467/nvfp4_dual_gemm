SHARK TANK ROUND 8: SHARK 1 "THE SKEPTIC" - SCORECARD
====================================================

PITCH A: 3/10 - Ignores architecture, thread-unsafe on tiled_mma.set() calls.
         Will corrupt MMA state silently 30-50% of the time due to race
         conditions. Pipeline configured with 1-thread consumer intentionally.
         REJECT.

PITCH B: 7/10 - Architecturally sound. Warp 0 produces (TMA/S2T), Warps 1-3
         consume (MMA). Per-warp MMA partitions avoid thread-safety issues.
         Infrastructure already exists. Will deliver 2-3x speedup (not 1.2x as
         claimed). Safe, proven pattern. FUNDABLE as backup.

PITCH C: 5/10 - Multi-tile clever but breaks dual-GEMM fusion potential. Each
         warp loads separate B tile = 4x B bandwidth instead of 2x. Shared A
         contention causes 1.5-2x performance drop. Complicated epilogue.
         Realistic gain: 1.3-1.8x (not 2-4x). Too risky for low return.

PITCH D: 9/10 - Best technical analysis. Proves pipeline is intentional (line 146:
         consumer_group set to 1 thread by design). MMA already per-warp (line 176).
         Root cause: CONTROL is bottleneck, not data. Solution: separate producer
         (Warp 0 TMA/S2T) from consumer (Warps 1-3 MMA) loops. Enables 3-4x gain
         AND unblocks dual-GEMM fusion. Architecture-respecting, future-proof.

MY VOTE: PITCH D

REASON: This is a leaderboard competition, not a hackathon. Pitch B is the safe 2-3x
        win. But Pitch D is CORRECT architecture that delivers 3-4x minimum and
        enables future optimizations (dual-GEMM fusion adds another 1.3x). The
        author understands WHY the restriction exists (pipeline design, not bugs),
        which is the mark of deep technical insight. That's what wins competitions.

INVESTMENT THESIS: Fund the engineer who asks WHY before implementing WHAT.

DETAILED ANALYSIS: See round8_shark1_vote.md

KEY FINDING: The 75% idle thread problem isn't a coding bug—it's an architectural
choice in the reference implementation. The solution respects that architecture
while unlocking all 4 warps through careful loop restructuring.
